## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I used this challenge to remember a little bit of web development. It was a bit tricky to get trought at the beginning, but as time passed and I remembered more and more things, it became very easy and fun to do.

### Continued development

I had 2 problems while doing this little project, first the naming of the classes, id, variables and etc. And second the overall organization of the code, so i plan to continue doing projects to get better at naming things and organizing my code.
